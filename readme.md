As to abide by the rules that CS50 and Harvard have requested, I will withhold all problem set solutions. However, I will upload my final projects for various CS50 classes here
So far I have only completed:
* CS50P - An introduction into Python class solely focused on Python for 11 weeks of materials, including nine problem sets and one final project. 

In progress I have:
* CS50X - An introduction into programming with 1 week teaching Scratch, 5 weeks teaching C, 1 week Teaching Python, 1 Week teaching SQL, 1 week teaching HTML, CSS and Javascript, 1 week teaching Flask, and 1 week teaching emojis.

* CS50G
